1n53fzg,politics,Fmr. CDC director says you can no longer trust the CDC website: “Never thought I would see the day”,"Everything's become an opinion piece from conservative ""news"" outlets to even government health agencies.    Trump hired his cabinet members for mainly just two reasons: 1) loyalty to him and not going to question Trump 2) telegenic and looks/sounds good on tv.    Fox News personalities make up the majority of his cabinet because they're both fiercely loyal to Trump and have years of tv and media experience. With Kennedy, Trump fawns over the Kennedy legacy and desperately wants to be loved like JFK.",1

1n55zd3,politics,"Already Pardoned by Trump, Jan. 6 Rioters Push for Compensation","> On Thursday, one of the lawyers, Mark McCloskey, said during a public meeting on social media that he had recently met with top officials at the Justice Department and pitched them on a plan to create a special panel that would dole out financial damages to the rioters — much like the arrangement of a special master to award money to the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  > Mr. McCloskey said that he wanted the panel to be overseen by Jeanine Pirro, who runs the federal prosecutors’ office in Washington that took the lead in filing charges against nearly 1,600 rioters who joined in the Capitol attack.  And further down...  > On Saturday, for example, Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys who was freed by Mr. Trump from a 22-year prison term stemming from Jan. 6, posted what amounted to a list of demands to the administration in a social media message. Among the things he called for were compensation for the rioters “for their suffering and that of their families” and the firing of “everyone involved” in the riot cases.  > “If this isn’t done,” Mr. Tarrio wrote, “we will all hang together.”  > On Sunday, another rioter, Ryan Nichols, a former Marine who was sentenced to more than five years in prison for joining a crowd that shoved at officers in a tunnel outside the Capitol, doubled down on his attacks against the police in a post on social media.  We're on the road to empowering and enabling vigilantes.  > “I’d do it again given the same situation,” Mr. Nichols said. “They attacked Americans and killed innocent protesters.” He added that “we should have” dragged foes “through the streets.”",1
