And further down...  > On Saturday, for example, Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys who was freed by Mr. Trump from a 22-year prison term stemming from Jan. 6, posted what amounted to a list of demands to the administration in a social media message. Among the things he called for were compensation for the rioters “for their suffering and that of their families” and the firing of “everyone involved” in the riot cases.  > “If this isn’t done,” Mr. Tarrio wrote, “we will all hang together.”  > On Sunday, another rioter, Ryan Nichols, a former Marine who was sentenced to more than five years in prison for joining a crowd that shoved at officers in a tunnel outside the Capitol, doubled down on his attacks against the police in a post on social media.

This initiative had previously funded local efforts to identify and prevent potential mass shooters.   >The downsizing included reducing the center's staff from 45 full-time employees to just a handful and eliminating numerous contracts.  >\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  >For instance, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety's grant was intended to create a statewide threat assessment and management team focusing on active shooters and related threats. Similarly, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office's grant sought to enhance collaboration among various professionals to address mass violence risks.  >DHS officials defended the decision in a statement, claiming, “the grant program previously administered by CP3 was nothing more than a slush fund for left-wing ideologies, and did next to nothing to combat actual threats in our communities.”  >However, critics argue that these programs were essential in equipping local agencies with the tools needed to prevent violence. Democratic Representative Betty McCollum, along with five other lawmakers, had previously urged DHS in a letter to reinstate the funding, citing the importance of such initiatives in the face of increasing threats to schools and religious institutions.  >\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  >“This event in Minneapolis was 100 percent preventable. This was exactly the kind of event we could have stopped,” a former DHS employee, speaking to *CNN* anonymously to avoid jeopardizing their deferred resignation, said.  Another example of poor Republican leadership led by the idiot-in-chief Donald Trump that can be measured in blood spilt and lives lost.   Their excuse for cutting funding was calling it a slush fund for left wing ideologies.  Prevention of gun violence is considered to be a 'left-wing' ideology to Trump and Republicans because their corruption has deep ties to the gun industry.  We've tried their way, more guns for years.  It hasn't change a thing.  Just more of the same.

Christians back Trump despite him being a horrible and immoral person. Conservatives back him despite him massively raising the deficit. Military people back him despite him saying soldiers who die are losers. Republicans as a whole seem to have given up on fair elections and democracy despite invading the Middle East 20 years ago to ""spread democracy"".  And that's without mentioning all the alternative facts, denialism, conspiracy theories, lies, misinformation etc that they're constantly putting out and believing. Don't get me started on flat earthers.  Why has half the US gone absolutely bonkers in the last couple of decades? How can they be so willing to throw all their values under the bus?

That emotional response will not be swayed by objective facts.   The truly scary people are the cynical and power hungry figures like JD Vance and Speaker Mike Johnson who know exactly who and what Donald Trump is, and pretend to support him and his goals, as a useful avenue to enacting their own agenda.",21

1n415bq,NC native here. We have several major urban areas that lean blue. Raleigh Durham chapel hill as one. Charlotte/mclenburg as the other. And Winston salem/greensboro as the third.   Outside of that the state is very rural and very red. You don’t even have to drive that far from those areas to see the most country areas that consistently vote Republican. And they have a death grip on those voters.  On top of that we have voter suppression which takes place on a regular basis. Voter registration isn’t exactly easy. And Voter purges are pretty common. our Supreme Court race in this last cycle featured a judge Allison Riggs who was fighting against voter purges in an attempt to make her lose her seat.   The state has also had sub par senate candidates recently. Cherri Beasley wasn’t great. And cal Cunningham was caught in an infidelity scandal that nuked his campaign.   Roy cooper does have a very good chance this year as a senate candidate though. As a former governor he’s well known and fairly popular through the state.,117

1n3h9ca,"One of the realities of Newsom is that he’s actually the Democrat with the most power.   Federal Dems have no power, best they can do is stall.   It’s our states that need to protect us, and as the leader of the most powerful blue state, he’s in the best position to make real moves.   The social media campaign is cathartic and hilarious - but the real impact is in his gerrymandering bill. That’s actually what matters.   I appreciate him stepping up, but I know he’s ambitious and wants to be President. That being said, Democrats being afraid of power or reluctant to take power is one of their biggest faults. So maybe that’s a trait we need.   Still 2028 is far away. If he’s successful with the gerrymandering, potentially saving the country in 2026 - he’d certainly have a good argument for the nod.

I am sure the founders thought that it was possible that the branches could collude together and it was ultimately up to the voters to prevent that. However, the founders never thought of Fox News, AM radio and social media and their ability to corrupt and control an entire voting base.

1n3f9s1,"The Founders DID intend for the House to match a growing population. Up until the 20th century the size of the US house would be recalculated after each census. The 1929 Reapportionment Act artificially capped the size of Congress at 435 members. Meanwhile, over the last 100 years the size of the US population has nearly tripled! but our number of representatives remains the same.

The USSR had all the things I listed by the beginning of 1990. But the sentiments for separation in one or another way existed for decades before that — it's just that the USSR didn't have freedom of the press and associations, let alone sociological polls, so the actual extent of the sentiments remained concealed.

1n16f29,"In addition to the response by u/BrownBoyBrock, both examples you give in the title of this post are examples of positions that have changed tremendously in importance over time.   Chief Justice was the head of what was initially the least powerful branch of the federal government. It was (and is still, technically) the only branch dependent on the other branches. At the time, it was difficult work. John Jay had a relatively light workload and did a tremendous amount of other work for the federal government, largely at the behest of Washington, but in general the life of a Supreme Court justice was pretty miserable. They travelled the country, were underpaid, and had to sit for relatively low level cases for the most part. And even Chief Justice was not a particularly influential position. As Governor of New York, John Jay could gain much more fame/regard and the position had much greater potential to become President or otherwise move to a more powerful position.  That is to say, at the time, Governor of New York would have been considered a greater role than Chief Justice.   Same pretty much for Vice President - at the time of Calhoun, Vice President was not a springboard to the presidency, but was instead a position of little regard or power. This was in the process of changing around that time, but it wasn’t until the 20th century even that the VP became a position of note. So again, Senator would have actually been the more influential, “greater,” position.  Edit to add: there’s more to Calhoun’s decision to leave the Vice Presidency as well, but I decided to just focus on how the influence of the position has changed.",38

Also, being a Federal politician is much more lucrative today. You can serve 2 terms in the Senate and get great benefits and high publicity.

1mz6m1w,"Nobody knows.  Nobody knows what the issues will be.  Nobody knows who the candidates will be, and they’re the ones who set the tone.  Nobody knows what events will happen between then and now.    I dispute that the midterms are a big indicator.  They’ll be a referendum on the Trump administration combined with how people feel with whatever message the Dems settle on.  Trump won’t be much of a concern in 2028, and the Dems message may shift considerably over two years depending on how successful it is, how events change things, and which candidates are big contenders.",118
1mz6m1w,"RNC will probably be full blown mask-off Christofascism. Expect to see bizarre and unsettling messianic messaging around Trump and all the illegal shit he has been doing, especially the current push to redistrict Dems into a permanent minority party and make him the forever god-king of America. Expect more lies about crime, tariffs, and the economy that will beggar belief for anyone with a functional frontal lobe.  DNC is a bigger question. There's probably never been more discontent with the toothless, tone deaf, virtue signaling establishment on the part of voters and those who find themselves more left of the generally moderate conservative Democratic Party. If Mamdani wins the NYC mayoral election (which he's heavily favored to), I expect there to be even more tension between the old guard and the younger supporters of the party who don't want to settle for being corporate-funded ""controlled opposition.""",38
1mz6m1w,"I agree that broadly speaking nobody knows about 2028. It's just so far away and a lot is going to happen. I also agree that a bad midterm isn't a death sentence for Republicans but if the GOP has a wave year for the midterms then that is seriously bad news for Dems. 2022 wasn't that great for Dems, 2024 was a disaster so if 2026 is a disaster it would show that the Dems have serious long term problems that aren't just about a given political environment.  I'd also be surprised if Trump really isn't a big factor in 2028. He will still be the president and the overall leader of the GOP. Trump has also dominated Republican politics for a decade now and I don't think that's suddenly going to change in the future. Even if Donald Trump himself can't run I think there's also a very good chance one of his kids will run. Being the center of the GOP gives the Trump family a ton of power and is pretty profitable. If the Republican primary voters broadly love Donald Trump in 2028 and one of his kids runs for president essentially as ""Donald Trump's third term"" then it would be hard for JD Vance or other Republicans to attack them without attacking Donald Trump himself. At the very least I think someone with the last name Trump will be one of the top three Republican primary candidates in 2028.",30
1mz6m1w,"“This will surely stop Trump, increasingly nervous area man says for seventh time”",28
1mz6m1w,"We're still pretty far off from the primaries and a lot is going to change to the point where I'm somewhat reluctant to make any firm predictions. In 2005 people weren't talking about a massive recession, in 2013 almost no one seriously thought Trump would run let alone win or that immigration would be a central focus of the campaign, in 2017 no one was talking about a pandemic.  Any predictions we make have a very high liklihood of being wrong. With that caveat I do think that Trump will still be a dominant figure in 2028. If Donald Trump himself cannot run then I think one of his kids will run for president and will have considerable support in the Republican primary. As long as Republican voters keep nominating Trumps then the Trump family will not stop running for president. To see the GOP move on from Trump we will need to see a Trump run for the primary and lose to another Republican.   For the Dems there's a lot of anti establishment energy. The Democratic primary voters are pissed at their own party for losing the presidency, house and senate in 2024 especially when the stakes were so high. They're also upset at what they see as a lack of fight and effort from the Dems. Whether this criticism is deserved or not is irrelevant. For Dems the overall most important issue is likely going to be electability/beating the GOP. Whoever can convince the Democratic voters they have the best odds will win the primary. This means Dems probably won't nominate someone too far left but if centrist Dems don't adequately show enough ""fight"" and reason to be trusted again it does open the door for a more leftwing candidate.",23

They clearly don't understand the rules of the great game they are forced to be a part of, whether they like it or not.  Primary challenges like Zohran Mamdani in NYC are a possible avenue, but you need candidates to step up for that. How is it that Hakeem Jeffries gets to hold his safe seat completely unopposed since 2013? Something is clearly wrong there.  I don't think a lot is going to change though. As you've correctly pointed out, Israel is a geopolitical partner of the US. On the opposing side, Hamas and Hezbollah are geopolitical partners of Iran. From a coldhearted geostrategic view, the US have no reason to do anything about this genocide because their position in the region actually stands to benefit from Palestine getting wiped off the map.
